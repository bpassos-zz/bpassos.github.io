Hi, I am Bruno Passos!

I am a Brazilian Web Designer and Front-End developer based in Amsterdam-NL and in love with the World Wide Web. I work for the amazing Booking.com, a brilliant company located in the heart of Amsterdam.

I love designing websites and web apps and developing them focusing on user experience. Less is more! I believe simplicity is the key to good design and web interfaces.

I am also the co-founder of Chirpag.com, a design videocast aimed to up and coming designers and seasoned pros. When I am not designing or developing for the web, I am enjoying the company of my two wonderful kids and the wife @katie_passos
