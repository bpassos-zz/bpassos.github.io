    <p>Hi, my name is Bruno Passos and I am a Brazilian web designer and front-end developer living in Amsterdam. I spend my days trying to create a better user experience for <a href="http://booking.com/destinationfinder.html">Booking.com</a>.

    In my spare time I love contributing to open-source projects, planning conferences and developing my skills.</p>
