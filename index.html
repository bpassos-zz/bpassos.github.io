    <p class="intro-description">Hi, my name is Bruno Passos, I am a Designer living in Canada and working as a User Experience Lead at <a href="http://shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> (previously UX Designer and Team Lead at <a href="http://booking.com.html" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>). I am also co-host of a brazilian podcast <a href="http://zofe.com.br" target="_blank">ZOFE</a> and co-founder of <a href="http://frontinamsterdam.nl" target="_blank">Front in Amsterdam.</a>

    <p class="intro-description">I have a huge passion for cultures and how humans behave. Having lived in four different countries I have had the chance to work and interact with some incredible people and study different user behaviours across a wide variety of mediums through the web.</p>

    I love contributing to open-source projects, enjoying the family with <a href="https://twitter.com/KatiePassos" target="_blank">@katiepassos</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brunopassos/"  target="_blank">photography.</a></p>
